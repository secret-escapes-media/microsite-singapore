    <p class="text--lg">As a hardened Londoner with a black belt in rush-hour tube skills, it was much to my own surprise that I found myself swapping the big smoke for a tropical country half the size. Here on the equator, life moves at a less frenetic pace - strange for a nation that’s evolved so rapidly into the thriving, modern city-state it is today. I love Singapore not just because the sun shines year-round and the subway is heavily air-conditioned, but because of its hidden enclaves and the sheer variety of architecture, culture and cuisines. Whether it’s a Michelin-star tasting menu or a simple bowl of noodles, the food rarely disappoints - and if there’s one thing Singaporeans love, it’s telling you where to find the very best.</p>
