  questions:

    - question: Where did you grow up?
      answer: My grandmother used to live in Joo Chiat, which is predominantly a Peranakan precinct. We lived here with my grandmother until I was about three or four and then moved to an HDB (public housing) in Toa Payoh.

    - question: What is Peranakan culture and why is its preservation so important to you?
      answer: "Peranakan culture to me is a mix of different cultures coming together, and manifesting itself in our attitudes, our behaviours and our identity. As a collector of antiques, I consider an item to be Peranakan if it was made for or by the Peranakans. For example, the beaded slippers that you have seen today were made by the Peranakans. The designs are European, but they were made locally. The porcelain that you see, called Nyonya wear (Nyonya meaning lady) were made in China but the colour, the design and the shape were commissioned for this community. I think preservation of any culture is important: it tells us where we came from, which then allows us to better know who we are today and to face the future."

    - question: When did you first start collecting antiques?
      answer: As a teenager, I remember watching a play and feeling embarrassed that I couldn’t understand the language, when everybody else in my family was able to speak it. I decided to start exploring my heritage by looking in antique shops and one of the very first pieces I bought was a planter’s chair - a totally un-Peranakan piece, but they were common in Peranakan homes nonetheless, including my grandfather’s. It cost a lot more to refurbish the rattan than to buy the chair!

    - question: What was your most exciting purchase and where did you find it?
      answer: Goodness, collecting antiques is like having a relationship. Every relationship is exciting and after a while (laughs) one finds excitement in other antiques. I hope that didn’t sound too bad! The chair that I’m sitting on belonged to a close family friend, who was also closely related to one of the presidents of Singapore. The president would visit the family every Chinese New Year and sit in this chair. So excitement in collecting is not always about the value, it’s about the story.

    - question: How did the idea for the museum come about?
      answer: "I never actually intended for it to be a museum, in fact I don’t even call it a museum. You’ll notice I call it The Intan, which means ‘rose cut diamond’. The Peranakans were fond of this European cut of diamond because it shows off the diamonds many facets. I called the house The Intan because it captures the different facets of Peranakan culture: the sound, the smell, the sight, the taste and the touch."

    - question: The museum is more than an exhibition of interesting artefacts, it’s your home. How does this shape the experience for visitors?
      answer: I guess the difference between The Intan and other house museums is that it is a ‘living museum’. The owner-collector still lives in it. So I have to juggle making it functional for me and at the same time meaningful for visitors who want to take away a little bit of understanding of the Peranakan culture. I have to have two-minute clean up plan and have to be very clear in demarcating spaces that are public and spaces that are private.

    - question: Food plays a big part in Peranakan heritage. If you could only recommend one Peranakan dish to try, what would it be?
      answer: Very tough question; almost as tough as asking a Peranakan boy to recommend a Peranakan restaurant, because mother’s cooking is always the best. My mother makes a mean mee siam. Some people call it legendary! As long as it’s complicated and made with love and effort, you can’t go wrong.

    - question: The museum is located in a beautiful terrace in Joo Chiat. How would you describe the local area?
      answer: This house was a very humble home lived in by a Peranakan family. This area is named after a Mr Joo Chiat, who came from China and married a Peranakan lady. The story goes that the government needed land to build a road between the Malay village to the sea so they could transport produce, and they asked Joo Chiat to sell them the land. Instead, he gave the land away and in return, the government named much of the neighbourhood after him, which made him even wealthier than he was.

    - question: What’s the perfect start to a day in Singapore?
      answer: Wake up early, around 5am. Try to go to a local market and have a simple breakfast in a residential housing estate.  Hear the sounds, observe the people and walk the corridors of the HDB. Take the MRT and see how efficient and cool it is!

    - question: What are your favourite visitor attractions in the city?
      answer: My favourite place in Singapore is the zoo. It’s something I grew up with and it was ahead of its time. I love Little India very much. I used to love in Bangladesh and to me it has a sense of humanness; it’s real and I feel the heartbeat there. I love the Botanical Gardens and especially the Orchid Garden. It’s a real paradise to see the flowers growing and waiting to bloom, and the stroke of colours.

    - question: What are the most unusual events you have held at The Intan?
      answer: We have had both a wedding ceremony and a death memorial. I always say, it’s not about the artefacts. Our vision is to inspire and to contribute to the local community, using Peranakan culture as the platform.

    - question: Which of Singapore’s smaller museums would you recommend?
      answer: I think we have done a wonderful job with our museums in Singapore. One of my favourites is The Malay Heritage Centre, and also The Indian Heritage Centre.

  occupation: National Kitchen by Violet Oon
  questions:

    - question: When did you open your first restaurant?
      answer: The first restaurant under the Violet Oon Inc Pte Ltd umbrella was opened in 2012 as Violet Oon’s Kitchen, a reincarnation of my original restaurants which opened and closed in the 1990’s. My two grown up children, Su-Lyn Tay, 41, and Yiming Tay, 36,  had decided in late 2011 to bring my heritage of cooking and sharing of Singapore hospitality to life and together, we went on to co-found our current restaurants.

    - question: The National Kitchen by Violet Oon is adorned with personal photographs. How much is the menu a celebration of family life around the table?
      answer: The photographs are not only my personal photographs but the photographs of many Singaporeans and and they are celebration of life around the dining table. The menu at the National Kitchen by Violet Oon is very much a celebration of Singapore’s different, multi-ethnic families. This celebration includes dishes from our home heritage, our restaurant heritage and from well-loved hawker food and our iconic creations over the years. In addition to my own beloved Peranakan dishes like Buah Keluak Ayam and Chap Chye, we have Singapore’s famed dishes like Chilli Crab, Fish Head Curry and Hainanese Chicken Rice, as well as lesser known family dishes like South Indian Idli.

    - question: What’s the key to the perfect laksa?
      answer: The key to the perfect laksa is a rich, indulgent and creamy texture from thick coconut cream laced with the aromatic and delicious spice paste comprising galangal, chillies and lemongrass amongst other spices, and overladen by the perfume of finely julienne Laksa Leaf (also known as Vietnamese mint). We have taken the “rich creaminess” up a notch by serving a laksa which is semi dry and in which all the flavours and textures are more intensely featured.

    - question: Who is the most interesting guest you have received at the National Kitchen?
      answer: This is difficult to say as we have had an amazing range of guests from our Prime Minister – Mr Lee Hsien Loong – to princesses, princes, avid foodies from at home and abroad, grandma and grandpa home cooks (we are most respectful of  them as they really know how to cook) and we love them all – for coming to dine with us and enjoying not only our food but our Singaporean hospitality.

    - question: What is your all-time favourite restaurant?
      answer: When I ate professionally for over 20 years as a food critic I used to say, “My favourite restaurant is round the corner, waiting to be discovered”. As a professional eater-outer you are always waiting to be excited by the next experience. A favourites is CUT in Beverly Hills, not only for the steaks which I love – but also for the buzz and sense of being part of the “scene”. It is not only about the food but also the experience. When I ate in Laserre in Paris in the 1980’s I was amazed by the ornate roof which opened up to the skies while I was dining – so a great meal includes the food, the hospitality and the scene, which a roadside stall can offer for the great local experience and a sense of being in touch with the simple life.

    - question: What makes Singapore such a fantastic destination for foodies?
      answer: "First: you can go “native” without risking food poisoning in our multitude of hygienic hawker centres. Secondly, you can eat a meal from around the world on one dining table. We love the eclectic dining experience in Singapore – where not only is the street food of Singapore and Southeast Asia, India and China represented, but you can also now find the food of Japan, Korea, the USA and France. This mix is represented in our more elegant foodie enclaves like Keong Saik Road, Kampong Glam and the CBD roads of Telok Ayer and Club Street. I have even enjoyed a Food Safari in the Keong Saik Road area, starting with Esquina for tapas and going onto a famous Cantonese porridge shop called Tiong Shian Eating House, finishing off with dessert at a durian stall."

    - question: The hawker centres can be quite overwhelming. What would be your advice to a first-time visitor?
      answer: "First-time visitors should select a relatively spacious, breezy and easy-to-navigate hawker centre. I would suggest Tiong Bahru Market – you get a preview of the orderliness of the place when you ascend from the ground floor to the second level by escalator! Breakfast and lunch are good times to explore, especially in the mornings when there is a lively market on the ground floor with vegetables, fruit, meat and seafood stalls. What is lovely about Tiong Bahru Market is that it has the modern conveniences without being “modernised” – the market as well as the food stalls have all existed for decades and are well known for quality ingredients and food."

    - question: What does it mean to you to have a restaurant in the National Gallery?
      answer: "Personally, as a Singaporean, aged 68, with a family whose roots go back to before the 20th Century – at least 150 years in Singapore – being invited to create the National Kitchen and to have it feature my name as National Kitchen by Violet Oon is truly an honour and a responsibility. I was so imbued with the gravitas of the task on how to represent our food in its most proper and honest way. My own purpose is to curate, chronicle and capture the most authentic recipes and the essense of Singapore food and the Singapore way of eating. This building is our former City Hall and has great memories for me personally. As a journalist I used to run up and down the central stairs to interview government officials when I was a music and arts writer and an investigative reporter. Our restaurant on the second level used to house our own Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after our independence in 1965, and we get many people coming up to tell us where their desk used to be  – so our space also resonates with many Singaporeans."

    - question: When you’re not busy running your restaurants, what else do you like to do in Singapore?
      answer: I love to chill out in Singapore’s traditional corner coffee shops doing nothing – just watching the sky and clouds and the cars whizz past is a relaxing experience. I also love going to our libraries and looking for mystery, murder and mayhem books which I devour ferociously. I love, in particular, reading murder mysteries in hotel rooms where I scare myself. I’m a bit of a Singapore hotel junkie. The Capella on Sentosa is set amidst rolling hills and greenery, with luxurious rooms where you get to believe you are leading the lifestyle of the rich and famous. Going on staycations with my grandchildren is something I love doing – at least two times a year.

    - question: What do you love most about Singapore?
      answer: For a woman, Singapore is a lovely place to be alone or with friends and where I can enjoy a seamless journey from day to night and on to the early hours of the morning. I think nothing of feeling peckish at 2am, calling for a cab and going out looking for supper. And to be able to walk through the whole arts enclave in town during our Night Festival. One year, there was a 24-hour night festival event!

    - question: Plans for the future?
      answer: With Violet Oon Singapore, we hope to be able to bring our Singapore food story to the world capitals of food, like London, New York and Shanghai.
